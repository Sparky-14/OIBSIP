    <ul>
      <li>30 April ,1987 :</li>
      <p>
        Sharma was born on 30 April 1987 in Bansod, Nagpur, Maharashtra.His mother, Purnima Sharma, is from
        Visakhapatnam, Andhra Pradesh.His father, Gurunath Sharma, worked as a caretaker of a transport firm storehouse.
        Sharma was raised by his grandparents and uncles in Borivali because of his father's low income. He would visit
        his parents, who lived in a single-room house in Dombivli, only during weekends.He has a younger brother, Vishal
        Sharma.
      </p>
      <li>1999:</li>
      <p>
        Sharma joined a cricket camp in 1999 with his uncle's money. Dinesh Lad, his coach at the camp, asked him to
        change his school to Swami Vivekanand International School, where Lad was the coach and the cricket facilities
        were better than those at Sharma’s old school. Sharma recollects, "I told him I couldn't afford it, but he got
        me a scholarship. So for four years I didn't pay a penny, and did well in my cricket".Sharma started as an
        off-spinner who could bat a bit before Lad noticed his batting ability and promoted him from number eight to
        open the innings. He excelled in the Harris and Giles Shield school cricket tournaments, scoring a century on
        debut as an opener.
      </p>
      <li>March 2005:</li>
      <p>
        Sharma made his List A debut for West Zone against Central Zone in the Deodhar Trophy at Gwalior in March 2005.
        Batting at number eight, he scored 31 not out as West Zone won by 3 wickets with 24 balls remaining. Cheteshwar
        Pujara and Ravindra Jadeja made their debuts in the same match.It was Sharma's unbeaten innings of 142 in
        123 balls against North Zone at the Maharanna Bhupal College Ground in Udaipur in the same tournament that
        brought him into the limelight.[10] He visited Abu Dhabi and Australia with the India A squad and was then
        included among India's 30-member probables list for the upcoming ICC Champions Trophy tournament, although he
        did not make the final squad.
      </p>

      <li>July 2006:</li>
      <p>
        Sharma made his first-class debut for India A against New Zealand A at Darwin in July 2006. He scored 57 and 22
        as India won by 3 wickets.He made his Ranji Trophy debut for Mumbai in the 2006–07 season and scored 205 off 267
        balls against Gujarat.Mumbai went on to win the tournament with Sharma scoring a half-century (57) in his second
        innings in the final against Bengal.
      </p>

      <li>December 2009</li>
      <p>
        Sharma has spent his entire domestic first-class career at Mumbai. In December 2009, he made his highest career
        score of 309 not out in the Ranji Trophy against Gujarat.In October 2013, upon the retirement of Ajit Agarkar,
        he was appointed team captain ahead of the 2013–14 season.
      </p>

      <li>November 2013:</li>
      <p>
        In November 2013, during Sachin Tendulkar's farewell series, Sharma made his Test debut at Eden Gardens in
        Kolkata against West Indies and scored 177, the second-highest score on debut by an Indian to Shikhar Dhawan
        (187).He followed it up with 111 (not out) in the second Test at his home ground, the Wankhede Stadium in
        Mumbai.
      </p>
      <li>October 2019:</li>
      <p>
        In October 2019, in the third Test against South Africa, Sharma scored his 2,000th run and his first double
        century in Tests. He made 212 in the first innings of the match.Sharma was named as vice-captain of India's Test
        team during the tour of Australia in 2020, replacing Cheteshwar Pujara.
      </p>
      <li>March 2015:</li>
      <p>
        In March 2015, Sharma made his first appearance in the Cricket World Cup and played in eight matches for India
        in the 2015 tournament in Australia. India reached the semi-final stage where they were defeated by Australia.
        Sharma scored 330 runs in the tournament with one century, a score of 137 in the quarter-final against
        Bangladesh
      </p>
      <li>15 April 2019</li>
      <p>On 15 April 2019, Sharma was appointed vice-captain of India's squad for the 2019 World Cup in England.In the
        opening match against South Africa, he scored 122, including his 12,000th run in international cricket.He
        followed it up with centuries against Pakistan, England and Bangladesh. In the match against Sri Lanka, hitting
        yet another century, he became the first batsman to score five centuries in a single World Cup tournament,and
        equalled Tendulkar's record for the most centuries (6) in all World Cup matches.Sharma totalled 648 runs in the
        tournament to finish as the leading run-scorer and win the ICC's Golden Bat award, the third Indian player to do
        so.</p>
      <li>2012:</li>
      <p>
        He had a disastrous loss of form in 2012 and scored only 168 runs in the whole calendar year at the very low
        average of 12.92 with just a single half-century. Even so, his captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni showed faith in him,
        and his career was revived in 2013. Dhoni decided to move him up the batting order to open the innings with
        Shikhar Dhawan in the 2013 ICC Champions Trophy. The pairing was a success and India won the competition,
        defeating hosts England in the final.
      </p>
      <li>13 November 2014:</li>
      <p>His good form continued and, later in the year against Australia, he scored 141 (not out) in Jaipur. He
        followed that with 209 off 158 balls in Bangalore and established a then-world record for the most sixes (16) in
        a one-day international innings (since beaten by Eoin Morgan of England with 17).[56] On 13 November 2014,
        playing against Sri Lanka at Eden Gardens in Kolkata, Sharma broke the world record for the highest score in a
        one-day international innings with 264 from 173 deliveries.
